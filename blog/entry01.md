### Tool 
For this school year, I am working with Aron on this Freedom Project. We have decided to learn [Unity](https://unity.com/), a game engine. Before this decision, we made a list of gaming engines we might want to learn for the rest of the school year. Here is the list:

1. Unity
2. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
3. [Cry Engine](https://www.cryengine.com/)
4. [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/)
5. [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)

Unity was our top choice. I personally like Unity because of the sheer amount of [documentation](https://docs.unity.com/) and tutorials we can take advantage of. I started creating a Unity account to tinker with the game engine. I had to verify if I was a student or not so I could get the student plan (the student plan is free and it gives you additional free resources). This for me was not as easy a task as my partner. We had to upload a document showing you are a current student. However, the document that I uploaded wasn't accepted. I tried to upload different documents two more times and I still wasn't verified. The verification machine didn't let me upload any more documents. I contacted the support team for this issue. Fortunately, they were able to verify my school status. Now, I can use the Unity Editor to tinker around.

My partner and I decided to work on building a Player vs. Environment game.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Currently, I am in stages 1 and 2 of the **Engineering Design Process** which are to `define the problem` and `research the problem`. Although these stages aren't really relevant to what state of the Freedom Project I am in now, you could say that the stage, `define the problem` is defining which tool to use for this project, and `research the problem` is tinkering with the tool. In the next stage, `Brainstorm possible solutions`, my partner and I will be planning how the game should work and start building something relevant to the game.
