### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Currently, I am in stage 2 of the **Engineering Design Process** which is to `research the problem`. Right now, my partner and I are learning our tool and making separate mini projects. After finishing up our project, we will be on stage 3 of the **EDP** which is to `brainstorm possible solutions` which is to planning to set up how our game is going to work.

### Skills
I have improved my skills in *How to learn* and *Attention to detail*. Right now, I am learning how to operate the Unity editor and I have to learn C# which Unity uses. I am taking extra time outside of school to make sure that I am familiar on how the editor works. When an error pops up, I have to fix it or else there is no result. By improving the skill, *Attention to detail*, I am being more careful on debugging the code. I make sure to follow every step of the tutorial.
