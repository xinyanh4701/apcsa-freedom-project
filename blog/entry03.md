# Entry 3
##### 2/11/24
Aron created an interactable keypad and an animated door.

On my end, after the break, Aron and I were assigned tasks. Aron made a sketch of the map which he is currently making the map. In addition, he is also making the AI bots when the player attacks and the bots pursues the player for attacking it. For my roles, I am making the health bar and AI bot to patrol. I am using Natty GameDev's videos to help me achieve this goal.

I use Natty GameDev's resources to make a template of a healthbar. The files were zipped. After I extracted them all, I didn't know why I couldn't upload those assets as a package. I individually uploaded one asset at a time. A problem that I encountered was trying to make the frame of the healthbar to be in the correct format. The slanted side of the healthbar should be to the right, not left.

For the next break which is mid-winter recess, I am planning to finish up the health bar and AI patrol.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Right now, Aron and I are currently in stage 3 of the **EDP** which is to `brainstorm possible solutions`. We have started our main project. Aron and I have separate roles for this project. I would say that we are in stage 4 of the Engineering Design Process (EDP) which is to `plan the most promising solution`.

### Skills
One skill that I am working on is *time management*. I have to manage homework from other classes. In order to get sufficient time to work on this project, I need to be more efficient and plan out how much time I should allocate for each day. Another skill I want to improve is *communication*. Right now, Aron and I are only talking on discord and in APCSA. I don't have any classes with him besides APCSA. In the beginning of this project, we used to talk more often. Now, we haven't really communicated on Discord. Hopefull, we will devise a plan to communicate often.
