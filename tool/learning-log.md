I have finished watching and following [#1 FPS Movement: Let's Make a First Person Game in Unity!
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJqP5EesxLk&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=2) and [#2 FPS Raycast Interactions: Let's Make a First-Person Game in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPPGnpV1Y1c&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=2). I solved my problem with the 2D Vector Composite by the help of this [link](https://forum.unity.com/threads/no-option-of-2d-vector-composite-in-input-system-1-0-0.888607/) that I found. The second half of the second video doesn't make sense to me.

I had a problem with seeing the objects in the scene section. I could only see the directional light. When I click on an object, I would only see the frame of the object. On 12/11/2023, Aron found out that my shading mode was wireframe not shaded.

I am going to watch and follow [#2.5 Interaction Events! :Let's Make a First Person Game in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UIiwzfZoZA&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=3).

12/18/23

I did not finish completing the tutorial but, I am at `3:52`. I am having trouble with compiling my C# scripts. Without compiling correctly, I won't be able to move my object or make the object interact with other objects. I need to fix this compiling error. I learned how to assign color to an object. 

What's next:

I am going to complete [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UIiwzfZoZA&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=3). I am also going to watch the [How to make a Better Health Bar in Unity : Chip Away Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFASjEuhyf4&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=4) video.

I finished watching and following [#2.5 Interaction Events! :Let's Make a First Person Game in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UIiwzfZoZA&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=3) 

1/8/24

I am trying to solve the problems I am facing with the C# scripts. I can't add the scripts to the component of an object. The scripts aren't compiling. I searched online about this problem.

1/15/24

Aron set up the main project repo. I am installing wsl to my computer. I ran into problems and hopefully, I will get to finish the setup.

1/22/24

I finished set up. I am now learning more about the Unity Editor through the [Unity website](https://learn.unity.com/). I am currently learning about [creating UI buttons](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/creating-ui-buttons).

1/29/24

Aron and I started doing our roles for the game. I am making the health bar for the characters and AI patrolling (NPC character just walking around). Aron sketched two designs of a possible environment that we will use for our game. I chose this one:

This was the other design that Aron sketched:
