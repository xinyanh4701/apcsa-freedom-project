I have finished watching and following [#1 FPS Movement: Let's Make a First Person Game in Unity!
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJqP5EesxLk&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=2) and [#2 FPS Raycast Interactions: Let's Make a First-Person Game in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPPGnpV1Y1c&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=2). I solved my problem with the 2D Vector Composite by the help of this [link](https://forum.unity.com/threads/no-option-of-2d-vector-composite-in-input-system-1-0-0.888607/) that I found. The second half of the second video doesn't make sense to me.

I had a problem with seeing the objects in the scene section. I could only see the directional light. When I click on an object, I would only see the frame of the object. On 12/11/2023, Aron found out that my shading mode was wireframe not shaded. 

What's next:

I am going to watch and follow [#2.5 Interaction Events! :Let's Make a First Person Game in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UIiwzfZoZA&list=PLGUw8UNswJEOv8c5ZcoHarbON6mIEUFBC&index=3).
